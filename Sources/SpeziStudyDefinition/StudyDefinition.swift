/// A type that can appear in a ``StudyDefinition``.
public typealias StudyDefinitionElement = Hashable & Codable & Sendable


/// Defines a Study, as a composition of metadata, components, and a schedule.
///
/// ## Studies
/// The SpeziStudy package models a study definition as a combination of study metadata, a list of study components, and a list of schedules for these components.
/// A study is identified via its ``id``, which must be unique across all studies and is not allowed to change throughout a study's lifetime.
///
/// A study's ``Metadata-swift.struct`` bundles all non-content-related information about the study, such as e.g. its unique id, user-visible title and description, participation criteria, etc.
/// The actual "content" of the study is defined via the ``Component`` and ``ComponentSchedule`` types: a study is a set of components, each of which represents some "thing" that can happen
/// as part of a user's participation in the study.
/// Additionally, the study contains a list of component schedules, which define when each component should be activated.
///
/// Currently, there are 3 kinds of components:
/// 1. ``InformationalComponent``s, which display static informational text, e.g. an article;
/// 2. ``QuestionnaireComponent``s, which prompt the participant to answer a questionnaire;
/// 3. ``HealthDataCollectionComponent``s, which configure and enable background collection of HealthKit data.
///
/// The ``StudyDefinition`` type is explicitly designed to be used with Swift's `Codable` infrastructure: it conforms to both the `Encodable` protocol, as well as `DecodableWithConfiguration`.
/// This allows apps to easily locally persist study definitions across app launches, and to transfer them between devices, e.g., an a study app could host its study definition on a server and then
/// on each launch dynamically fetch the current version of the study from the server, thereby eliminating the need to tie the study's definition (and any changes made to it) to specific versions of the app.
///
/// Every ``Component`` within a study definition is `Identifiable` and must have a strong identity, which is not allowed to change throughout the lifetime of the study.
///
/// ## Study Evolution
/// There are two kinds of possible changes the ``StudyDefinition`` type (as well as apps/libraries using it) must be able to cope with:
/// 1. **Study Content Evolution:** changes made within a study; e.g., adding a new component, modifying an existing component, adjusting some component's schedule, etc.
/// 2. **Study Definition Evolution:** changes made not to individual studies, but to the ``StudyDefinition`` type itself; e.g., adding/renaming/removing a property, changing a type, etc.
///
/// SpeziStudy provides facilities for gracefully dealing with these kinds of changes; see <doc:StudyEvolution> for more information on this.
