    /// Study Components model schedulable and usually completable tasks or events that happen as part of a study participation.
    ///
    /// ### Component Kinds
    /// There are two kinds of components:
    /// 1. User-interactive components.
    ///     These are components which are displayed to the study participant, and typically require some kind of response.
    ///     Typically, these are used to initiate some form of data collection (e.g., prompting the user to answer a questionnaire, or to perform a six minute walking test),
    ///     but they can also be purely informational (e.g., displaying an article about some study-related topic to the user).
    /// 2. Internal, non-user-interactive components.
    ///     These are components which don't require any immediate user interaction and instead run in the background, e.g. to collect data.
    ///     An example of such a component is the background Health data collection.
    ///
    /// ### Component activation and Scheduling
    /// All study components operate on a schedule, which determines when (and how often) the component is activated.
    ///
    /// User-interactive components must have at least one explicit schedule defined in ``StudyDefinition/componentSchedules``; otherwise, they will simply be ignored and never do anything.
    /// Internal components are implicitly activated upon enrollment into the study.
