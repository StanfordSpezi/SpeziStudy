/// ## Usage
///
/// The ``StudyManager`` module handles enrollment into Studies, and coordinates the scheduling of a study's components.
///
/// ## Topics
///
/// ### Initialization
/// - ``init()``
/// - ``init(persistence:)``
///
/// ### Study Enrollment
/// - ``enroll(in:)``
/// - ``unenroll(from:)``
/// - ``informAboutStudies(_:)``
/// - ``StudyEnrollment``
